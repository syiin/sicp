There isn't a problem - the essential difference is that we don't need to know the balances of either account at the time of transfer. It is a fixed transfered amount so as long as methods that mutate the
balances within each account are atomic, you cannot have accesses or sets in between each other. ie. the state of one account depends on the state of another.
