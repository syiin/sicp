The number of additions without memoization is exponential
ie. fib(5) would need
          1 addition   +   2 additions   +   3 additions...etc 
            (0 + 1)       (0 + 1 + 2)         (0 + 1 + 2 + 3)
    for both streams (ie. fibs and (stream-cdr fibs))

A memoized version would need n additions because we would remember the 
value of the first addition so when (stream-cdr fibs) is called, it doesn't 
need to redo the computation
