101:	P1 sets x to 100 and then P2 increments x to 101.
121:	P2 increments x to 11 and then P1 sets x to x times x.
100:	P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P1 sets x.
11:	  P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x.n

On 11, does serializer not protect from set! x? Probably not because if only 2 methods are running, then you could worry only about serializing one since that is guaranteed to run atomically, so would the other


(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
