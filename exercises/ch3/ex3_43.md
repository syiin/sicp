(define (exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance) 
                       (account2 'balance))))
    ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
    ((account2 'deposit) difference)))

Events:
1. (account1 'balance)
1. (account2 'balance)
1. ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
1. ((account2 'deposit) difference)

1. For the first version, withdraw and deposits are only serialised within the same account and therefore, only atomic when 
   mutating itself and not in between exchanges. 
   So, you can get from
   a1: 10, a2: 20, a3: 30
   to
   a1: 20, a2: 20, a3: 20 if you calculate the differences first between a1 and a2, then a2 and a3, then proceed to set
   the values of everything

1. However, in this case, the total sum is conserved - because you cannot call set! on a single shared value one after the other
   ie. you always get to calculate the value to be set before calling set! since withdraw and deposit are atomic within each account, you never get a scenario where balance is calculated in one process, calculate in another and then both call set at the same time
