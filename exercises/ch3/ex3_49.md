If the process can't know which locks it needs ahead of time, it can't order them to protect them. 
ie. imagine needing to operate down a dynamic queue that has elements that act on a shared resource added in real time. You cannot know ahead of time what items are in the queue and therefore, how to decide which order to operate on.
